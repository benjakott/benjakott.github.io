        <h3>A Little Bit About Me</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Benjamin Kotthoff, and I am a freshman at the University of Missouri - Columbia. I am majoring in Atmospheric Sciences, but have a solid background in Cisco and Apple products. I graduated high school from Affton High School in St. Louis Missouri. My last two years of high school were split days, where I was going to a technical school as well with a focus on Cisco Networking. I graduated from the Cisco Networking Academy with my Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician (CCENT). At the technical high school, I competed in SkillsUSA for customer service, placing first in districts and state, and competed in Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) placing 3rd in nationals for Network Design. I am currently an iOS technician at Gravity in Columbia and am working my way towards my MacOS certification. In my free time, I like to spend my free time out in nature, kayaking, and biking. </p>
