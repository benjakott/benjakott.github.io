                <h3>iOS Technician and Network Engineer</h3>
                <h4>September 2019 - Current</h4>
                <p>As an iOS technician, I check in userâ€™s devices at the front desk and diagnose the issue in the case that it is an iOS device. If it is a MacOS device, I bring it back to my Mac Technicians. I then implement the solution to the problem, wether it be a software restore, screen replaced, battery replaced, or a whole unit replacement, and keep the user informed. I also am a Network Engineer, and will help set up networks at small businesses, run new cables, and implement new solutions to existing problems. </p>

                    <h4>May 2017 - January 2020</h4>
                    <p>As a front of house member, I would preform a wide range of tasks provide service to guests and to meet and exceed the expectations of the business as a whole. I worked dining room, clearing trays and tables, sweeping to floor, providing table touch-ins, and cleaning up spills. I also worked behind the counter, taking orders, handling cash and credit, and creating drinks. I also worked on headset in drive-thru, which is my specialty. On headset, I would accurately take an order while making the drinks and doing other tasks like refining lemonades or restocking soda lines at the same time. All of my tasks preformed were done in a timely manor while providing fantastic customer service.</p>

                    <h3>YMCA</h3>
                    <h3>Master of Ceremonies</h3>
                    <h4>May 2018</h4>
                    <p>At the YMCA, I was the master of Ceremonies, or MC. I provided information on upcoming talents, while including a joke or two in front of a crowd of over 500. This required me to memorize bits about the act, such as the name of the group, the song they were dancing to, and a piece of information about said group, if it was provided. It also required that I projected myself in a professional but welcoming manor. As a volunteer opportunity, it was a highly enjoyable experience and provided me with fantastic public speaking practice.</p>
