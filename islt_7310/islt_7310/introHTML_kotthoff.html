     Hello world, and hello IS_LT 4310! My name is Benjamin Kotthoff. I am a freshman majoring in Atmosphere Science. I work for a company in downtown Columbia called gravity and am an iOS technician there. I have been employed by Apple for close to two years now, including my job back in St. Louis. I also used to work for Chick-Fil-A as a front of house team member, so you may have noticed a “My Pleasure” here or there if this were an in-person course. I also apologize for this late discussion post. Very odd times recently, for all of you, I’m sure. I technically do have a past in web development, but it was a high school course with little to no meaning behind it. I tried forcing myself to do code academy, but I finally trapped myself into taking this course. My expectations are that this helps me with website development in the future, for if I wish to make my own sites. My favorite hobby is either kayaking or biking.
