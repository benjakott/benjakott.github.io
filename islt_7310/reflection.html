        <h2>My Reflection On My Career</h2>
        <div>
            <section>
                My career has focused mainly around customer service; however, as I continue my journey through the technology based business, I have shifted to balancing between this and the actual technical services.
                <h5>Chick-Fil-A</h5>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first job was at Chick-Fil-A, as a cashier. I mainly worked on the headsets in the drive-thru, for it was where I performed best. I could go through the guest’s orders quickly and accurately, upsell items, and provide astounding customer service, making sure to end every order with a, “Have a great rest of your day and enjoy your meal!” I always said this with a genuine smile, for I loved the workplace environment and the team members I worked with. I was never late and always enjoyed showing up to work, but I realized that food service is likely not my specialty. I needed to put my love for technology and passion for astounding customer service together.  
                <h5>MacHeadQuarters</h5>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always known my way inside and out of software like iOS, MacOS, and windows. Although as my time in the technology business continues, I have realized that there is much more that I need and want to learn. Many issues can be solved within the software, but many also need the hardware replaced instead. My time at MacHeadQuarters was spent as a technical specialist, where I would diagnose the issues in Mac computers, iPhone, Apple Watch’s, and other Apple Products. I have learned a significant amount from that, and I made a crucial mistake: I stopped learning, in theory. Once I had covered what I needed to fulfill my role in the team, I stopped there and did not try to go further. Looking back, I could have been a much more valuable asset to the company if I had continued my training to become a technician. After several months, there was a lack of available hours at my location, and I was laid off. I took back my job at Chick-Fil-A and continued to provide excellent customer service.  
                <h5>Gravity</h5>
	            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I entered freshman year of college, I left my home in St. Louis and moved out to Columbia, heading to the University of Missouri - Columbia. I am currently majoring in atmospheric sciences, but I still need a job there. I applied to work at Gravity, another Apple Premium Service Provider business. After I was offered the job, it was noted that I was expected to become an iOS technician, which intrigued me, but scared me at the same time. About a month and a half in, I had studied hard and took the iOS technician test. I passed on the first time, and had become an iOS technician, as well as a front desk attendant. I am continuing my learning of the hardware side of things and hope to be taking my MacOS technician test soon, and after that, my CompTia A+ test. I hope to continue on with my love of technology and meteorology and graduate, moving into broadcast or the private sector.
